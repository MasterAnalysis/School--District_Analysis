# School--District_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The goal of this project was to analyze maria files that show evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders data and perform the same analysis we did in our module such as cleaning data, renaming columns and adding col. The measurements that we want to analyze our data by include: total school budget, per student capita, average math and reading score, the passing percent for math and reading, and the overall passing percentage.

## Results
Much of the data results from the analysis remained the same. This makes sense given that we had a bigger set of data, and manipulating only a small portion of the data, columns math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School would  the data. Below is the table from the original analysis, which includes the math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School.

The following data  is from the most recent analysis, where the math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School was deleted. We can see that the only differences are the averages and percent passing in Thomas High School, Even with the removal of certain data, the overall results stayed similarly the same.

## Summary
The four drastic changes that occurred are the number of total students, the number of students counted at Thomas High School, the average math and reading scores, and the overall percentages for math and reading at Thomas High School. The deletion of data implies a decrease in the count of total students overall, and total students at Thomas High School, specifically for this analysis. And since the population amount was decreased, this leads to a change in average scores and score percentages.
